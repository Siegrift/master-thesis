This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setup and run

We use the next JS dependency cloned locally. When there is a change in those sources,
you have to reinstall the dependencies manually. You also need to remove the next.js
cache otherwise the old next.js code will be used. This will all be done by

```sh
yarn setup
```

To run the project in dev mode:

```sh
yarn dev
```
