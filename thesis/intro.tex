\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter_intro}

In this chapter we give a brief overview of cross-site scripting (XSS), which is one of the most
common web application vulnerabilities. We mainly focus on DOM-based XSS for which Trusted Types are
the most effective. We then explain the design of Trusted Types, how it helps to detect, and
mitigate these vulnerabilities. Lastly, we describe the motivation and background for our work.

\section{Cross-site scripting}

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most prevalent vulnerabilities on the web. It is an attack
of web applications taking untrusted user input and interpreting it as code without sanitization or
escaping. There are multiple categories of XSS. Most experts distinguish at least between
non-persistent \emph{(reflected)} and persistent \emph{(stored)} XSS. There is also a third
category, DOM-based XSS, which will be explained in more depth as this is a variant that Trusted
Types target.

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Stored -- A malicious injected script is permanently saved in a server database. The client
        browser will then ask the server for the requested page and the response from the server
        will contain the malicious script.
  \item  Reflected -- Typically delivered via email or a neutral website. It occurs when a
        malicious script is reflected off of a web application to the victim's browser
        \cite{reflected_xss}.
  \item  DOM-based -- The vulnerability appears in the DOM (\ref{def:dom}) by executing a malicious
        code. In reflected and stored XSS attacks one can see the vulnerability payload in the
        server response. However, in a DOM-based XSS, the attack payload is executed as a result of
        modifying the DOM environment in the victim's browser so that the client-side code runs in
        an unexpected manner.
\end{itemize}

Cross-site scripting vulnerability became more widespread with the boom of single-page applications
(\ref{def:spa}), where most of the behavior is achieved by modifying the DOM using JavaScript. There
are many functions, element attributes, and properties in the DOM API which interpret the arguments
as an executable code. We call these DOM sinks (\ref{def:dom_source_sink}). These sinks make it easy
for developers to accidentally introduce this vulnerability \cite{tt_web_framework_paper}.

  \label{img:xss}
\end{figure}

One of the most basic examples of XSS is the interpolation of URL parameters in the DOM. The
attacker can prepare a malicious URL which they then send to a victim. The victim executes the
payload just by navigating to the site sent by the attacker.

It can be misused by the following attack payload:

-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <div id="content"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const content = decodeURIComponent(location.search.substr(1))
      document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = 'URL content: ' + content
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}

The consequences of XSS vary a lot. Their severity can range from benign annoyances to unrecoverable
damages such as full account compromise, and disclosure of users' cookies, storage, secrets, or
session. Other attacks may use XSS to change the application content and present fraudulent
information to the user.

There are many attempts to reduce the risk of DOM XSS either by dynamic or static checkers. The
former usually suffers from performance and scalability issues when applied on large codebases while
the latter provides suboptimal results due to JavaScript's dynamic nature
\cite{tt_web_framework_paper} \cite{owasp_xss_cheatsheet}.

\section{Trusted Types}

Trusted Types is a relatively modern web API designed by Google based on a long history of
mitigating XSS \cite{tt_design_history}. They are currently supported in Chrome, Edge, and Opera.

It is a browser security feature that limits access to dangerous DOM APIs to protect against DOM
XSS. Trusted Types provide type guarantees to all frontend code by enforcing security type checks at
potentially user-controlled and malicious values. They are delivered through a CSP header and have a
report-only mode that does not change the application behavior and an enforcement mode that may
cause user observable breakages \cite{tt_background}.

When enforced, Trusted Types block dangerous injection sinks from being called with values that have
not passed through a Trusted Types policy \cite{tt_background}. If an untrusted value is passed to
sink a Trusted Types violation is raised and the DOM is unaffected. In practice, this means that a
potential DOM XSS has been prevented. There are many other resources that can be used to explore
Trusted Types in detail \cite{tt_resources}.

\subsection{Threat model}

Trusted Types is a powerful API. Its main goals are to \cite{tt_spec:goals}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item reduce the risk of client-side vulnerabilities caused by injection sinks.
  \item replace the insecure by default APIs with safer alternatives which are harder to misuse.
  \item encourage a design where the code affecting the application security is encapsulated in a
        small parts of an application.
  \item reduce the security review surface for applications and libraries.
\end{itemize}

The main idea behind Trusted Types is to make the dangerous DOM APIs secure by default and encourage
application authors to use safer APIs. This model is very effective for preventing DOM-based XSS.
However, there are still areas where Trusted Types are not effective enough and other security
measures are needed. Some of the non-goals of Trusted Types are \cite{tt_spec:non_goals}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item preventing or mitigating server side generated markup attacks -- Defending against XSS on
        both client and server can be really complex, especially for applications where parts of the
        code can run on both client and server, for example, as in Next.js (\ref{intro-nextjs}). To
        address these attacks, use the existing recommended solutions like templating systems or CSP
        \emph{script-src} directive.
  \item controling subresource loading -- Trusted Types deal with code running in realm of the
        current document and do not guard subresources.
  \item guarding cross-origin JavaScript execution, for example, loading new documents via
        \emph{data:} URLs -- Trusted Types do not guard cross-origin executions at all
  \item protecting against malicious developers of the web application -- It is implicitly assumed
        that untrusted developer can cause more severe damages. Attempting to guard against
        malicious developer would lead to more complex and impractical design.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content Security Policy}
\label{csp}

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate
certain types of attacks, including XSS and data injection attacks \cite{mdn_csp_def}. CSP provides
a way for browsers to create safer APIs in a backward compatible manner since the API has to be
opted in explicitly by the application server by sending the CSP response header or using the CSP
inside the HTML meta tag in the response body. If the browser does not support the CSP directive,
the directive is ignored and the standard browser behavior applies.

Trusted Types are enabled through a CSP using two different directives:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{require-trusted-types-for} -- This directive instructs user agents to control the
        data passed to DOM XSS sink functions (\cite{mdn:require-trusted-types-for}).

        % Add space to ensure there is no blank page in introduction
        \vspace{5mm}
        \bigskip

        \begin{lstlisting}[language={}, caption=Syntax of \emph{require-trusted-types-for directive}]
Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script';\end{lstlisting}

  \item \emph{trusted-types} -- This directive instructs user agents to restrict the creation of
        Trusted Types policies (\cite{mdn:trusted-types}). Syntax:

        \bigskip
        \begin{lstlisting}[language={}, caption=Syntax of \emph{trusted-types directive}]
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types;
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types 'none';
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types <policyName>;
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types <policyName> <policyName> 'allow-duplicates';\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}

These directives together enable and configure Trusted Types behavior for the particular web
application. They allow the application authors to define rules guarding write access to the DOM
sinks and thus reducing the DOM XSS attack surface to small parts of the web application. These
smaller parts can be modularized where they can be more easily monitored, reviewed, and maintained.

Apart from the standard \emph{Content-Security-Policy} header, there is also
\emph{Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only} which can be used to enable Trusted Types in a
report-only mode. In this mode, Trusted Types violations are only interpreted as warnings. This way
the application can gradually work on Trusted Types compliance without breaking the existing users.
It is also recommended to use the report-only mode in production for some time to make sure the
integration is working as expected \cite{tt_web_framework_paper}.

Once Trusted Types are enabled, the browser changes the behavior of insecure DOM API sinks and
expects "trusted" values instead of regular strings. These trusted values are created via Trusted
Types policies.

\subsection{Trusted Types policies}
\label{subsec:tt_policy}

The core part of Trusted Types API are policies which are factory functions for creating "trusted"
values that can be safely passed to DOM sinks when Trusted Types are enabled. The policies are
created by the application and access to them should be restricted. In javascript, this can be
easily achieved by encapsulating a policy in its own module and exporting only very specific
functions which use this policy internally. The values created from the policies are unforgeable and
immutable, meaning there is no way for an attacker to pass a value to dangerous DOM APIs.

\vspace{5mm}
\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Creating a Trusted Types policy, label={lst:create_tt_policy}]
const allowAll = (value) => value
const createHTMLCallback = allowAll;
const createScriptCallback = allowAll;
const createScriptURLCallback = allowAll;
const myPolicy = window.trustedTypes.createPolicy('my-policy', {
  createHTML: createHTMLCallback,
  createScript: createScriptCallback,
  createScriptURL: createScriptURLCallback,
});
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Create trusted value using a policy]
const trustedHtml = myPolicy.createHTML("<span>safe html</span>");
\end{lstlisting}

% Add space to ensure there is no blank page in introduction
\vspace{5mm}

The code listing \ref{lst:create_tt_policy} creates a Trusted Types policy using the callback
functions. This callback function is called when the policy is used to create a trusted value. It
receives a sink value of a string type as an argument and returns a string value that should be XSS
free and thus can be trusted. In practice, this function may be implemented as an \emph{identity
  function} if the payload is known to be trusted. Another example of policy callback implementation
would be to sanitize a sink value or perform certain whitelist logic. In case the payload should not
be used or can not be sanitized, the function should return \emph{null} or \emph{undefined} which
will trigger a Trusted Types violation.

\vspace{5mm}
\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Using a policy to sanitize HTML values]
const myPolicy = window.trustedTypes.createPolicy('sanitize-html', {
  createHTML: (untrustedValue) => DOMPurify.sanitize(untrustedValue),
});
\end{lstlisting}

It is important to ensure that policies are either secure for all possible inputs, or limit the
access to insecure policies, such that they are only called with inputs that are not attacker
controlled \cite{tt_spec:best_practice_policy}.

\subsection{Default policy}

There is one special case for Trusted Types policies. Applications may create a policy called
"default". This policy has special behavior. When a string value is passed to a DOM sink when
Trusted Types are enabled, the user agent will implicitly flow the untrusted string value through
the default policy. The callback function of the default policy receives three arguments instead of
one -- the string payload, sink type, and a sink name respectively. This allows the application to
recover from an unexpected sink usage, for example, by sanitizing the untrusted value. If the
default policy does not exist, it returns \emph{null} or \emph{undefined} a CSP violation will be
triggered \cite{tt_spec:default_policy}. Applications can use this policy to enable enforcement mode
even though the application is not fully Trusted Types complaint.

This feature is intended to be used by applications with legacy or third-party code that uses
injection sinks. The policy callback functions should be defined with very strict rules to prevent
bypassing security restrictions enforced by Trusted Types API. For example, having an "accept all"
default policy allows malicious attacker payloads to reach the DOM sinks. Developers should be very
cautious when using the default policy and preferably use it only for a transitional period until
the offending code is refactored not to use the dangerous DOM sinks \cite{tt_spec:default_policy}.

\vspace{5mm}
\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Creating a default policy \cite{tt_spec:default_policy}]
trustedTypes.createPolicy('default', {
  createScriptURL: (value, type, sink) => {
    return value +
      '?default-policy-used&type=' +
      encodeURIComponent(type) +
      '&sink=' +
      encodeURIComponent(sink);
  }
});
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reviewability}

Consider the process of security reviews for web applications, specifically reasoning about
DOM-based XSS. There are many tools and methodologies which can help reason about the application
security, but there is no automated way that can assert the safety of a web application. This means
that it is still necessary for security engineers to manually review the implementation and look for
potential vulnerabilities and analyze them.

When focusing on client-side XSS, the engineer has to determine whether an application uses
dangerous DOM sinks, either implicitly or explicitly, and whether there is a way for an attacker to
misuse them.

% Add space to ensure there is no blank page in introduction
\vspace{5mm}
\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Possibly dangerous function]
function setHtml(element, html) {
  element.innerHTML = html;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Is the function in the listing above safe? There is not enough information to answer this. The
safety of the function depends on the context of how it is used. More generally, the safety of a
function depends on both its direct and indirect callers, both present and future ones
\cite{tt_design_history}.

% Add space to ensure there is no blank page in introduction
\vspace{5mm}
\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Usage of the possibly dangerous function, label={lst:dangerous_fn_usage}]
  function processHtml(html) {
    setHtml(document.body, html);
  }

  function processUserData(data) {
    log('Processing user data');
    // Is this safe? Can this call change "data.html"?
    someThirdPartyCall(data);
    processHtml(data.html);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Looking for the callers of the function can be difficult because of the dynamic nature of
JavaScript. Also, JavaScript is a mutable language which makes it harder to reason about function
calls, especially the third-party ones.

When the application enforces Trusted Types, the engineer does not have to care about the dangerous
functions, and its callers. The focus of the security review shifts to reasoning about the creation
of trusted values, and policies. Once a trusted value is created, it is immutable and the policy
which created it provides the security guarantees. When a trusted value reaches a sink, this
guarantee still holds independently of how the value flew the callers. Consider the third-party call
in the listing \ref{lst:dangerous_fn_usage} and assume \emph{data.html} contains a TrustedHTML
value. If a third-party call modifies this value a violation is thrown when it is passed to a DOM
sink.

\subsection{Browser support and polyfill}

Trusted Types are currently supported in the Chromium family of browsers
\cite{mdn:tt_compatibility}. Developers creating Trusted Types compliant applications should always
check if Trusted Types API is available in the current execution context, which does not necessarily
need to be a browser. It is very common for Node.js applications to pre-render the client-side code
on the server to provide faster experience for the end users. This brings additional complexity, new
attack vectors in the forms of reflected XSS, various kinds of injection and more, which are out of
Trusted Types scope.

An additional benefit of Trusted Types compliant applications is that all sinks are protected. The
application can use a polyfill for browsers that do not support Trusted Types, maintaining the same
security properties as in the browsers where they are supported \cite{xss_nowhere_with_polyfill}.

There are multiple variants of the polyfill:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Full -- Creates the API of Trusted Types, parses the HTML meta tag from the web page
        and enables the enforcement in the DOM.
  \item API only -- Creates the API of Trusted Types so the application can use policies and create
        trusted values. However, no enforcement rules are applied.
  \item Tiny -- Polyfills only the most important part of the API surface with a single line of code
        for a minimal bundle size.
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation and background}

Trusted Types provide the opportunity to significantly reduce the risk of a client-side XSS and has
been proven in various projects of various scale \cite{tt_web_framework_paper}
\cite{tt_integration_list}. However, projects need to refactor parts of their code, which can be
difficult, especially in the open-source ecosystem where the software is composed of multiple
dependencies which can not easily be modified. This presents a large barrier in Trusted Types
adoption \cite{tt_web_framework_paper} with a "chicken and egg" problem. There is not enough
pressure for framework authors to migrate to Trusted Types because there is not enough usage.
However, there is not enough usage because a lot of applications are prevented to migrate because
their dependencies do not work with Trusted Types.

Security engineers and software developers have often different priorities, the former focusing on
security, the latter on the application features. Trusted Types bridge this gap by providing secure
by default software. The ideal scenario would be if the open-source libraries used Trusted Types
transparently to the application authors.

In this paper, we try to analyze some of the most popular open-source frameworks and libraries to
show that there are workarounds for projects to use Trusted Types without too many difficulties. We
want to implement some integrations and an example application to encourage application and
framework authors to adopt Trusted Types to eradicate DOM-based XSS.
