\label{kap:sequence_alignment} % id kapitoly pre prikaz ref

In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein
to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or
evolutionary relationships between the sequences. \cite{Gollery2005BioinformaticsSA}

\section{DTW - dynamic time warping}
Dynamic time warping (DTW) finds similarity between sequences. It is one of the similarity methods
used in pattern recognition and time series data mining and other fields. Figure 1 shows example
of non-warping and warping between time series. DTW is efficient similarity method for time series
datasets, but it has quadratic complexity.
