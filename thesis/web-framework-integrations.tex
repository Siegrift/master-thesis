\chapter{Integrations into web frameworks and libraries}

Web frameworks and libraries is a software that is designed to support development of web
applications and services. They try to solve common problems faced in web development, such as
building user interfaces, testing, building and bundling the application. Typical web application
consists of numerous libraries and software frameworks which together create the resulting web
application.

In this chapter we describe the frameworks we examined and integrations we implemented. We document
each unique properties of the integration, sinks found and the respective solutions implemented.

\section{Next.js integration}

Next.js is one of the most popular frameworks for building web applications. The framework is build
upon the React library which is the most used library as of 2021 \cite{react_most_used_2021}. Parts
of a Next.js application can be rendered statically, server side or fully client side on a page by
page basis. Next.js is thus not only about the client side code, but it can also handle server side
logic which opens up different means of attacks such as reflected XSS, SQL injections and more.

Next.js was our initial choice for Trusted Types integration, because of the large impact this
integration would have. The framework itself seemed interested in the integration of Trusted Types
for a longer time \cite{nextjs_tt_pr_2020}.

We started working on the integration and created a basic Next.js application for testing. We used a
local version of Next.js as a dependency for our application. The example application was not
working when Trusted Types were enforced and we needed to make some changes in the Next.js. We ended
up with a working version of the integration which supported the application in dev mode with
Trusted Types under enforcement mode. We managed to accomplish this with one simply Trusted Types
policy in a short timeframe.

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Example of Next.js Trusted Types API]
let policy;

const whitelistAll = (str) => str;

// The policy getter is a private part of the module
// and cannot be used directly.
const getOrCreatePolicy = () => {
  if (policy) return policy;

  policy = window.trustedTypes?.createPolicy('next', {
    createHTML: whitelistAll('createHTML'),
    createScript: whitelistAll('createScript'),
    createScriptURL: whitelistAll('createScriptURL'),
  });
  return policy;
};

export const __unsafeAllowHtml = (html) => getOrCreatePolicy()?.createHTML(html) ?? html;

export const __unsafeAllowScriptUrl = (scriptUrl) => getOrCreatePolicy()?.createScriptURL(scriptUrl) ?? scriptUrl;

export const __unsafeAllowScript = (script) => getOrCreatePolicy()?.createScript(script) ?? script;
\end{lstlisting}

The fixes needed were small and the Trusted Types API specific code was encapsulated in a single
small module. That said, the implementation was only a proof of concept. However, we found out that
there are other engeneers working on this integration and we decided not pursue this project
further. Instead we shifted our focus to a different projects and integrations.

\subsection{Fixing violations reported by Tsec}

Tsec found 8 violations \cite{tsec_output} inside Next.js sources. Out of these 7 were indeed
Trusted Types violations that needed to be fixed. Some of these could be fixed simply on a type
system level since they expected a value from the user. The others needed to be explicitely allowed
through a policy. The implementation for this proof of concept can be found on github
\cite{nextjs_fix_tsec_violations_commit}.

Since our utmost goal was to find the sinks and create a prototype for the integration we wrapped
all of these values in Trusted Types objects. This was to be revisited in the future.

\subsection{Fixing the dev mode of an example application}

Fixing the violations found by Tsec was not enough and the application still would not work under
Trusted Types enforcement. This was caused by a webpack plugin used in one of the Next.js
dependencies which used eval internally. The workaround for this was to use a default policy and
allow all eval calls. The proper solution would be to fix the eval issue in the webpack plugin via a
policy.

Apart from this, there was another violation that was triggered caused by application during hot
reload (\ref{def:hot_reload}). Tsec did not to catch this problem, since the violation came from a
JavaScript file where the AST information was limited.

\section{Create React App integration}

Create React App (CRA) is a CLI and an officially recommended way to create single-page React
applications. It offers an easy React application setup with no configuration. The source code of
this tool does not depend on React directly. It is only used to generate the project files based on
a hard coded template and then it installs the latest version of React and other necessary
dependencies.

CRA was a second project we wanted to integrate Trusted Types to. Our goal was to make sure the
generated project is Trusted Types compatible.

\subsection{Using Trusted Types compatible version of React}

To accomplish this, we would need to change the implementation of CRA to install Trusted Types
compatible version of React. Unfortunately, such version of React is implemented only under a
feature flag which needs to be turned on at build time. The published version of React contains has
feature flag turned off. This means that in order to use the Trusted Types compatible version of
React you need edit the React source code, turn on the feature flag and then build the framework
yourself. You can then use this version of React as a dependency in your project generated by CRA.

Implementing this is non trivial, since it requires knowledge about React. More importantly though,
this is harder to maintain for the application authors since you need to keep up with the new
releases of React manually.

\subsection{Using Trusted Types compliant version of Webpack}

CRA internally uses webpack 5 to provide convenient development features and transfrom and bundle
application for production. Some of these features, especially hot module reload breaks under
Trusted Types in enforcement mode. Gladly, webpack can be configured to be Trusted Types compliant
by a small configuration change \cite{webpack_tt_config}.

The problem with CRA is that the webpack configuration is hidden from the user. Unfortunately, there
is no way how to override this configuration manually. This means that there is not a simple way how
to enable the Trusted Types integration. The workaround is to spy on imported JavaScript modules and
change what their content. This pattern is often used when mocking or spying in unit tests. However,
it is also a suitable solution for this case \cite{cra_modify_webpack_config}.

CRA team is reluctant to provide a convenient way to edit or override the webpack configuration,
since the provided defaults are good enough for the majority of users.

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Script to start React application with Trusted Types enabled in webpack]
// File 'scripts/start.js'
const rewire = require('rewire')
const defaults = rewire('react-scripts/scripts/start.js')
const webpackConfig = require('react-scripts/config/webpack.config')

// In order to override the webpack configuration without ejecting the create-react-app
defaults.__set__('configFactory', (webpackEnv) => {
  let config = webpackConfig(webpackEnv)

  // Customize the webpack configuration here, for reference I have updated webpack externals field
  config.output.trustedTypes = {
    policyName: 'webpack-policy',
  }

  return config
})
\end{lstlisting}

The application is then started simply by running this script using \emph{node} environment.

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Starting the CRA application]
node ./scripts/start
\end{lstlisting}

Another option is to use the \textit{eject} command from CRA. This is a one way operation and it
unwraps all of the hidden configuration and creates these files in the project. You can then edit
the webpack configuration which is now part of the project. This is not recommended and should be
used only when other attempts fail. The generated webpack configuration is pretty complex and
updating it in the future might not be trivial.

\section{Solid.js}
\label{section:solid}

Solid.js is a simple, modern and reactive framework for building user interfaces. Framework
syntax is largely inspired by React, but the internals are different. JSX internally makes use of
HTML template elements. Both frameworks are component oriented. The main difference is that React
uses a concept called \emph{virtual DOM} in which the UI representation is kept in memory and synced
with the "real" DOM. Solid.js does not use virtual DOM and performs all UI updates directly.

We have already described the Solid.js JSX transformation in the preprocessor chapter
(\ref{jsx_solid_preprocessor}) where we implemented a Trusted Types integration. We wanted to test
the changes on a real world project. Fortunately, there is fully fledged fullstack application which
we used \cite{original_solid_realworld_project}. We made a few additional changes, specifically:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Used custom version of Vite and Solid.js
  \item Added Trusted Types policies
  \item Implemented e2e tests
\end{enumerate}

Finally, we documented all the necessary changes needed to build the project and try the application
with all the integrated projects \cite{solid_realworld_project:readme}.

\subsection{Custom Vite and Solid.js}

The real world project uses Rollup as a bundler, but we decided to use replace Rollup with Vite,
because Vite is the preferred bundler for developing Solid.js application and we also wanted to test
that our integration works properly.

The only changes we needed to implement were to use our custom version of Vite and rename the file
extension for all source files from \emph{.js} to \emph{.jsx} in order for Vite to correctly pre
process the JSX. We also used the custom version of Solid.js to generate Trusted Types compliant
code after JSX transformation. You can see the code difference for these changes in
\cite{solid_realworld_project:vite}.

\subsection{Adding Trusted Types policies}

After all of the dependencies were ready, we needed to enable the Trusted Types enforcement. We used
a HTML meta tag and enabled all of the policies needed. Because hot reloading in Vite reloads the
full module, we had to use \textit{'allow-duplicates'} to allow recreating the policy when it's
module is reloaded. Having this is not be needed for production.

\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Creation of style elements using innerHTML in Vite \cite{commit_vite_inner_html_styles}]
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="require-trusted-types-for 'script'; trusted-types solid-dom-expressions trusted-article vite-overlay 'allow-duplicates';"
/>
\end{lstlisting}

We also needed to create a Trusted Types policy for the application itself. One of the source files
uses a third party API to load a HTML content and assigned that into \emph{innerHTML} property. This
could easily lead to an XSS if the API was malicious or got hacked. This means that Trusted Types
helped find and prevent a possible attack vector. Since the application used this only for
demonstration purposes we decided to allow this pattern via a policy.

You can see these changes in \cite{solid_realworld_project:tt_policy}.

\subsection{Implemented e2e tests}

After making sure the application works as intended both in development and production, we decided
to create e2e tests to verify this. We chose Cypress as the testing framework and created our own
testing plugin which is described in its own chapter (\ref{cypress_testing_plugin}). You can see the
implementation of these tests in \cite{solid_realworld_project:tests}.
